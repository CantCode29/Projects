        <p>The very first time we spoke, I had no idea you would become so important in my life. I thought you'd be another person that comes and goes like the wind. I guess you had other plans.
            I still remeber the feeling on my face when I saw you on campus, like seeing an old friend for the first time in forever and knowing that the spark wasn't gone. To think you gave me
            the wrong number! 😭 And got mad at me for not messgaing you 😒. But finally I saw you for the last time and you gave me the right number and thus begins the story of how we fell in love.

            Finally after months of us talking and dancing around the concept of being together I finally gained the courage to ask you out. I remeber being with Ontahatile picking out the necklace 
            that I'd give you after asking you to be mine. I was sooooo nervous even though i felt like I knew you'd say yes it was still daunting and nerve wrecking. But you said yes and I was so happy,
            I was so happy that I wanted to jump of the mountain! not really, but you get the point. Im so Happy and bless to have such a beautiful, caring, divine women in my life to be with me through the
            life. I love you so much peanut ❤️ and heres to many more anneveries to come.🥂 p.s I hope you enjoyed the day 😊
